MANAGEMENT\\n11\\nPerform Qualitative Risk Analysis assesses the priority of identifed risks using their relative probability or \\nlikelihood of occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, as well as other \\nfactors such as the time frame for response and the organization’s risk tolerance associated with the project \\nconstraints of cost, schedule, scope, and quality..Such assessments refect the risk attitude of the project \\nteam and other stakeholders..Effective assessment therefore requires explicit identifcation and management \\nof the risk approaches of key participants in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process..Where these risk \\napproaches introduce bias into the assessment of identifed risks, attention should be paid to identifying bias \\nand correcting for it..\\nEstablishing defnitions of the levels of probability and impact can reduce the infuence of bias..The time \\ncriticality of risk-related actions may magnify the importance of a risk..An evaluation of the quality of the \\navailable information on project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of the risk’s importance to the project..\\nPerform Qualitative Risk Analysis is usually a rapid and cost-effective means of establishing priorities for Plan \\nRisk Responses and lays the foundation for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, if required..The Perform Qualitative \\nRisk Analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as defned in the project’s risk \\nmanagement plan..This process can lead into Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis (Section 11.4) or directly into Plan \\nRisk Responses (Section 11.5)..\\n11.3.1 Perform Qualitative risk Analysis: Inputs\\n11.3.1.1 risk Management Plan\\nDescribed in Section 11.1.3.1..Key elements of the risk management plan used in the Perform Qualitative Risk \\nAnalysis process include roles and responsibilities for conducting risk management, budgets, schedule activities \\nfor risk management, risk categories, defnitions of probability and impact, the probability and impact matrix, \\nand revised stakeholders’ risk tolerances..These inputs are usually tailored to the project during the Plan Risk \\nManagement process..If they are not available, they may be developed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis \\nprocess..\\n11.3.1.2 Scope Baseline\\nDescribed in Section 5.4.3.1..Projects of a common or recurrent type tend to have more well-understood risks..\\nProjects using state-of-the-art or frst-of-its-kind technology, and highly complex projects, tend to have more \\nuncertainty..This can be evaluated by examining the scope baseline..\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI

11.2.3.1..The risk register contains the information that will be used to assess and prioritize \\nrisks..\\n11.3.1.4 Enterprise Environmental Factors\\nDescribed in Section 2.1.5..Enterprise environmental factors may provide insight and context to the risk \\nassessment, such as:\\n•\\t Industry studies of similar projects by risk specialists, and\\n•\\t Risk databases that may be available from industry or proprietary sources..\\n11.3.1.5 organizational Process Assets\\nDescribed in Section 2.1.4..The organizational process assets that can infuence the Perform Qualitative Risk \\nAnalysis process include information on prior, similar completed projects..\\n11.3.2 Perform Qualitative risk Analysis: tools and techniques\\n11.3.2.1 risk Probability and Impact Assessment\\nRisk probability assessment investigates the likelihood that each specifc risk will occur..Risk impact \\nassessment investigates the potential effect on a project objective such as schedule, cost, quality, or performance, \\nincluding both negative effects for threats and positive effects for opportunities..\\nProbability and impact are assessed for each identifed risk..Risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings \\nwith participants selected for their familiarity with the risk categories on the agenda..Project team members and \\nknowledgeable persons external to the project are included..\\nThe level of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective is evaluated during the interview or meeting..\\nExplanatory detail, including assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are also recorded..Risk probabilities \\nand impacts are rated according to the defnitions given in the risk management plan..Risks with low ratings of \\nprobability and impact will be included within the risk register as part of the watch list for future monitoring..\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412\\n.This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for

risk responses based on their risk rating..\\nRatings are assigned to risks based on their assessed probability and impact..Evaluation of each risk’s importance \\nand priority for attention is typically conducted using a look-up table or a probability and impact matrix..Such a \\nmatrix specifes combinations of probability and impact that lead to rating the risks as low, moderate, or high \\npriority..Descriptive terms or numeric values can be used depending on organizational preference..\\nEach risk is rated on its probability of occurrence and impact on an objective if it does occur..The organization \\nshould determine which combinations of probability and impact result in a classifcation of high risk, moderate risk, \\nand low risk..In a black-and-white matrix, these conditions are denoted using different shades of gray..Specifcally \\nin Figure 11-10, the dark gray area (with the largest numbers) represents high risk: the medium gray area (with \\nthe smallest numbers) represents low risk, and the light gray area (with in-between numbers) represents moderate \\nrisk..Usually, these risk-rating rules are specifed by the organization in advance of the project and included in \\norganizational process assets..Risk rating rules can be tailored in the Plan Risk Management process to the specifc \\nproject..\\nProbability and Impact

it may develop ways to determine one overall rating for each risk..Finally, opportunities \\nand threats are handled in the same matrix using defnitions of the different levels of impact that are appropriate \\nfor each..\\nThe risk score helps guide risk responses..For example, risks that have a negative impact on objectives, \\notherwise known as threats if they occur, and that are in the high-risk (dark gray) zone of the matrix, may require \\npriority action and aggressive response strategies..Threats found in the low-risk (medium gray) zone may not \\nrequire proactive management action beyond being placed in the risk register as part of the watch list or adding \\na contingency reserve..Similarly for opportunities, those in the high-risk (dark gray) zone, which may be obtained \\nmost easily and offer the greatest beneft, should be targeted frst..Opportunities in the low-risk (medium gray) zone \\nshould be monitored..\\n11.3.2.3 risk data Quality Assessment\\nRisk data quality assessment is a technique to evaluate the degree to which the data about risks is useful \\nfor risk management..It involves examining the degree to which the risk is understood and the accuracy, quality, \\nreliability, and integrity of the data about the risk..\\nThe use of low-quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis of little use to the project..If data quality is \\nunacceptable, it may be necessary to gather better data..Often, the collection of information about risks is diffcult, \\nand consumes more time and resources than originally planned..The values used in the example in Figure 11-10 \\nare representative..The numbers of steps in the scale are usually established when defning the risk attitude of the \\norganization..\\n11.3.2.4 risk categorization\\nRisks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (e.g., using the RBS), the area of the project affected \\n(e.g., using the WBS), or other useful categories (e.g., project phase) to determine the areas of the project most \\nexposed to the effects of uncertainty..Risks can also be categorized by common root causes..This technique helps \\ndetermine work packages, activities, project phases or even roles in the project, which can lead to the development \\nof effective risk responses..\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412\\n.This

be considered more urgent to address..Indicators of priority may \\ninclude probability of detecting the risk, time to affect a risk response, symptoms and warning signs, and the \\nrisk rating..In some qualitative analyses, the assessment of risk urgency is combined with the risk ranking that is \\ndetermined from the probability and impact matrix to give a fnal risk severity rating..\\n11.3.2.6 Expert Judgment\\nExpert judgment is required to assess the probability and impact of each risk to determine its location in \\nthe matrix shown in Figure 11-10..Experts generally are those having experience with similar, recent projects..\\nGathering expert judgment is often accomplished with the use of risk facilitation workshops or interviews..The \\nexperts’ bias should be taken into account in this process..\\n11.3.3 Perform Qualitative risk Analysis: outputs\\n11.3.3.1 Project documents updates\\nProject documents that may be updated include, but are not limited to:\\n•\\t risk register updates..As new information becomes available through the qualitative risk \\nassessment, the risk register is updated..Updates to the risk register may include assessments \\nof probability and impacts for each risk, risk ranking or scores, risk urgency information or risk \\ncategorization, and a watch list for low probability risks or risks requiring further analysis..\\n•\\t Assumptions log updates..As new information becomes available through the qualitative risk \\nassessment, assumptions could change..The assumptions log needs to be revisited to accommodate \\nthis new information..Assumptions may be incorporated into the project scope statement or in a \\nseparate assumptions log..\\n11.4 Perform Quantitative risk Analysis\\nPerform Quantitative Risk Analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the effect of identifed risks on overall \\nproject objectives..The key beneft of this process is that it produces quantitative risk information to support decision \\nmaking in order to reduce project uncertainty..The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are \\ndepicted in Figure 11-11..Figure 11-12 depicts the data fow diagram of the process..\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412\\n.This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction..\\n334\\n

analysis, the \\nprocess may be used to assign a numerical priority rating to those risks individually..\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412.This copy is a PMI Member

Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy \\nfor the project, to decide how the risk management processes will be executed, and to integrate Project Risk \\nManagement with all other project management activities..\\n Effective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan..This plan describes how the \\nrisk management processes should be carried out and how they fit in with the other project management \\nprocesses..On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project \\nmanagement, and the management processes in the rest of the organization..To provide the greatest benefit, \\ninitial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the \\ncorresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan..The risk \\nmanagement plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders \\nbecome clearer or change..\\n Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management \\nplan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the specific risk management activities should be \\nestablished in order to better track, control, and, as necessary, defend the corresponding expenditures \\nthroughout the project..The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project \\nbudget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated, \\nallocated, and managed..The risk management plan will define the monitoring methods to ensure that the \\ncorresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved \\nbudget for risk management can be modified..\\n In the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration, risk management \\nactivities need to be repeated throughout the project..The risk management plan should define both the \\nnormal frequency for repeating the processes as well as specific or exceptional conditions under which the \\ncorresponding actions should be initiated..The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated \\ninto the project management plan..\\n There are two categories of success criteria for risk management: those for success of the project in \\ngeneral, and those for success of Project Risk Management..\\n20\\n4\\n\\nCHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT\\n \\n• Project-Related Criteria..To assess the success of Project Risk Management, the stakeholders \\nmust agree on an acceptable level of results for the project-related criteria (such as cost, time, and \\nscope)..In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management \\nplan should present these objectives with reference to the project definition documents..To provide \\nguidance in risk management, particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also \\nprioritize each project objective..\\n \\n• Process-Related Criteria..The measures for success in Project Risk Management depend on a \\nnumber of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project..For example, the Project \\nRisk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than \\nfor a project with a more predictable environment..A research Project Risk Management process \\nmay be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be \\nallowable for a successful process in a more predictable project..\\n The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant \\nstakeholders..The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be infl uenced by a number \\nof factors, all of which need to be identified..These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and the \\nrelative importance to them of achieving or missing specific project objectives..The output of this analysis \\nshould then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the \\nProject Risk Management processes in the specific project..\\n Guidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders should \\nrefl ect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders..The project manager should \\nmaintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware of \\nany changes in the stakeholders’ attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts \\ninto account..\\n It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks, \\nand that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be defined in a \\nmanner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders..If qualitative analysis \\nuses such terms as “high impact” or “medium probability,” these should be defined objectively in the risk \\nmanagement plan..Similarly, the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in \\nquantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control..\\n Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a \\ntemplate of the risk register that will be used for recording risk-related information..The risk management plan \\nshould also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management \\nprocesses should be applied; this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the specified risk \\nmanagement objectives..\\n In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project \\nteam and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate, their criteria \\nfor determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond \\nthis level..The risk management plan specifies the project’s risk management roles and responsibilities and \\ndefines the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel..\\n21\\n\\n4\\nCHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT\\n Risk-related communication occurs at two levels: (a) within the project team, and (b) between the project \\nteam and the other project stakeholders..The principles for each of these categories of communication are \\ndefined in the risk management plan..For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various \\nrisk management meetings and reports required to carry out the corresponding Project Risk Management \\nprocesses as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports..For the other stakeholders, the \\nplan sets their expectations as to the structure, content, and frequency of routine documents to be received \\nas well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events..Details of the \\ninformation required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly defined..\\n 4.2 Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Management Process \\n The principal criteria for a valid risk management plan are acceptance by the stakeholders, alignment \\nwith the internal and external constraints on the project, balance between cost or effort and benefit, and \\ncompleteness with respect to the needs of the Project Risk Management process..Critical success factors for \\nthe Plan Risk Management process are detailed below..\\n 4.2.1 Identify and Address Barriers to Successful Project Risk Management \\n The time and effort required to carry out the Plan Risk Management process will not be supported unless \\nthe stakeholders, and especially management in the organization responsible for the project, recognize and \\naccept the benefits of managing risk, and the added value of addressing this as a skill in its own right rather \\nthan as a passive or reactive component of general project management..\\n A clear definition of the project objectives and a high-level view of the project environment and solution \\napproach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management..The project manager should therefore \\nensure that valid definition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity..\\n An organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and \\nmay expend an inappropriate amount of time and effort on this..Alternatively it may use a proprietary or \\npre-existing approach which requires tailoring..The availability of some or all of the following organizational \\nprocess assets contributes to the chances of success of the Plan Risk Management activities: standard \\ntemplates, predefined risk categories, and an established project management methodology incorporating \\nrisk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making, when it is \\nrequired, and a definition of concepts and terms, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels..Access to relevant \\nlessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project..The risk management plan will not deliver its value unless Project Risk Management is carried out as \\nan integral part of the project..The corresponding activities should be built into the project work breakdown \\nstructure and included in the corresponding schedule, budget, and work-assignment documents..\\n22\\n\\n4\\nCHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT\\n 4.2.2 Involve Project Stakeholders in.Project Risk Management \\n .The project manager needs to involve the project stakeholders in the Plan Risk Management activities to \\nbuild on their skills and experience as well as to ensure their understanding of, and commitment to, the full \\nProject Risk Management process..\\n The provision for risk management resources specified within the risk management plan should be \\napproved by management at a level adequate for carrying out the required Project Risk Management processes \\nin accordance with agreed-upon objectives..Management should be involved in the analysis of the level of \\nresourcing required for managing project risk and accept the risks that may arise from specific limitations \\nplaced on the provision of resources..Disagreements between stakeholders in the areas of risk tolerance and \\nevaluation measures should be addressed and resolved..\\n 4.2.3.Comply with the Organization’s Objectives, Policies, and Practices \\n The feasibility of risk management planning is dependent upon the features of the organization in which \\nit is carried out..The rules and guidelines defined in the risk management plan should be compatible with the \\nculture of the organization, its capabilities from the point of view of people and facilities, and its values, goals, \\nand objectives..\\n Project management in general, and risk management in particular, contribute to the organization’s effective \\ngovernance..The risk management plan should identify and take into account the relevant organizational \\nprocedures and any other enterprise environmental factors that apply such as strategic risk management or \\ncorporate governance processes..\\n 4.3 Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Management Process \\n 4.3.1 Planning Sessions \\n Planning sessions are recommended in order to build a common understanding of the project’s risk approach \\nbetween project stakeholders and to gain agreement on the techniques to be used for managing risk..\\n Elaboration of the risk management plan often serves to develop an effective means for the team to work \\ntogether since a similar consultative team approach will be used in subsequent stages of the risk management \\nprocess..The participants should include: the project manager, selected project team members and other \\nstakeholders, members of the broader organization having responsibility for risk, and other subject matter \\nexperts or facilitators, as needed..\\n At this point, the initial risk responsibilities, methodology, templates, terms, definitions, time schedules, and \\ncost budgets for the other Project Risk Management processes should be assigned and accepted..The specification \\nfor the tools that will be used in subsequent processes should include all parameters and other inputs required \\nto ensure their applicability to the specific project..These should be documented in the risk management plan, \\nwhich, when formally approved, is the principal deliverable of the Plan Risk Management process..\\n23\\n\\n4\\nCHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT\\n 4.3.2 Templates \\n In order to benefit from experience and existing best practice, risk management planning should take into \\naccount relevant existing templates for work products, such as risk status reports, risk breakdown structures \\nor the risk register..A decision should be made as to which templates are relevant to the project, and these \\nshould then be adapted and included in the risk management plan..\\n 4.4 Documenting the Results of the Plan Risk Management Process \\n The results of risk management planning are documented in the risk management plan..The plan serves \\nto provide all project stakeholders with a common view of how the risk-related activities of the project will be \\nhandled, what has been agreed upon, and a description of the stakeholders’ involvement and responsibilities \\nin these activities..An overview of the key areas of focus is given in Figure 4-1..\\n \\n Figure 4-1..Key Areas of Focus for the Plan Risk Management Process \\n Depending upon the size and complexity of the project, some or all of the following elements will be present \\nin a risk management plan..\\n Introduction; \\n• \\n Project description; \\n• \\n Risk management methodology; \\n• \\n Risk management organization; \\n•.Roles, responsibilities, and authority; \\n• \\n Stakeholder risk tolerance; \\n• \\n Criteria for success; \\n• \\n Risk management tools and guidelines for use; \\n• \\n Thresholds and corresponding definitions; \\n• \\n Templates; \\n• \\n Communications plan; \\n• \\n Strategy; and \\n• \\n Risk breakdown structure..\\n• \\n25\\n\\n5\\n CHAPTER 5 \\n IDENTIFY RISKS \\n 5.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Identify Risks Process \\n A risk cannot be managed unless it is first identified..Consequently, after risk management planning has \\nbeen completed, the first process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the \\nknowable risks to project objectives..\\n It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project..Over time, the level of project \\nrisk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project (internal change) \\nand of externally imposed change..\\n The purpose of risk identification is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable..The fact that \\nsome risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify \\nRisks process to find new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process..\\n When a risk is first identified, potential responses may also be identified at the same time..These should be \\nrecorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate..\\nWhere such responses are not implemented immediately, these should be considered during the Plan Risk \\nResponses process..\\n 5.2 Critical Success Factors for the Identify Risks Process \\n The practices described in Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.10 will maximize the value and effectiveness of the \\nIdentify Risks process and enhance the likelihood of identifying as many risks as practicable..\\n 5.2.1 Early Identification \\n Risk identification should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle, recognizing the paradox \\nthat uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the \\nrisk identification..Early risk identification enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks \\ninherent in the project, and may result in changes to the project strategy..It also maximizes the time available \\nfor development and implementation of risk responses, which enhances efficiency since responses taken early \\nare often normally less costly than later ones..\\n26\\n\\n5\\nCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n 5.2.2 Iterative Identification \\n Since not all risks can be identified at any given point in the project, it is essential that risk identification is \\nrepeated throughout the project life cycle..This should be done periodically, at a frequency determined during \\nthe Plan Risk Management process..Risk identification might also be repeated at key milestones in the project, \\nor whenever there is significant change to the project or its operating environment..\\n 5.2.3 Emergent Identification \\n In addition to invoking the Identify Risks process as defined in the project plan, the Project Risk Management \\nprocess should permit risks to be identified at any time, not limited to formal risk identification events or \\nregular reviews..\\n 5.2.4 Comprehensive Identification \\n A broad range of sources of risk should be considered to ensure that as many uncertainties as possible that \\nmight affect objectives have been identified..\\n 5.2.5 Explicit Identification of Opportunities \\n The Identify Risks process should ensure opportunities are properly considered..\\n 5.2.6 Multiple Perspectives \\n .The Identify Risks process should take input from a broad range of project stakeholders to ensure that \\nall perspectives are represented and considered..Limiting risk identification to the immediate project team is \\nunlikely to expose all knowable risks..\\n 5.2.7 Risks Linked to Project Objectives \\n Each identified project risk should relate to at least one project objective (time, cost, quality, scope, etc.),.\\nnoting that the PMBOK ® Guide defines risk as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive \\nor a negative effect on a project’s objectives..Consideration of each project objective during the Identify Risks \\nprocess will assist in identifying risks, noting that some risks may affect more than one objective..Complete Risk Statement \\n Identified risks should be clearly and unambiguously described, so that they can be understood by those \\nresponsible for risk assessment and risk response planning..Single words or phrases such as “resources” \\nor “logistics” are inadequate and do not properly communicate the nature of the risk..More detailed risk \\ndescriptions are required which explicitly state the uncertainty and its causes and effects..\\n27\\n\\n5\\nCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n 5.2.9 Ownership and Level of Detail \\n Risks can be identified at a number of levels of detail..A generalized or high-level description of risk can \\nmake it difficult to develop responses and assign ownership, while describing risks in a lot of detail can create \\na great deal of work..Each risk should be described at a level of detail at which it can be assigned to a single \\nrisk owner with clear responsibility and accountability for its management..Trigger conditions should also be \\nidentified where this is possible and appropriate..\\n 5.2.10 Objectivity \\n All human activities are susceptible to bias, especially when dealing with uncertainty..Both motivational \\nbiases, where someone is trying to bias the result in one direction or another, or cognitive biases, where \\nbiases occur as people are using their best judgment and applying heuristics, may occur..This should be \\nexplicitly recognized and addressed during the Identify Risks process..Sources of bias should be exposed \\nwherever possible, and their effect on the risk process should be managed proactively..The aim is to minimize \\nsubjectivity, and allow open and honest identification of as many risks as possible to the project..\\n 5.3 Tools and Techniques for the Identify Risks Process \\n A range of tools and techniques is available for risk identification..These fall into the following three \\ncategories, as illustrated in Figure 5-1:.\\n Figure 5-1..Three Perspectives of Risk Identification \\n28\\n\\n5\\nCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n 5.3.1 Historical Review \\n Historical reviews are based on what occurred in the past, either on this project, or other similar projects \\nin the same organization, or comparable projects in other organizations..Historical review approaches rely on \\ncareful selection of comparable situations which are genuinely similar to the current project, and filtering of \\ndata to ensure that only relevant previous risks are considered..In each case, the risks identified in the selected \\nhistorical situation should be considered, asking whether they or similar risks might arise in this project..\\n 5.3.2 Current Assessments \\n Current assessments rely on detailed consideration of the current project, analyzing its characteristics \\nagainst given frameworks and models in order to expose areas of uncertainty..Unlike historical review \\napproaches, current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points, but are based purely on \\nexamination of the project..\\n 5.3.3 Creativity Techniques \\n A wide range of creativity techniques can be used for risk identification, which encourages project \\nstakeholders to use their imagination to find risks which might affect the project..The outcomes or effectiveness \\nof these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively..These techniques can be used \\neither singly or in groups, and employ varying degrees of structure..These techniques depend on the ability of \\nparticipants to think creatively, and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator..\\n Each category of risk identification technique has strengths and weaknesses, and no single technique \\ncan be expected to reveal all knowable risks..Consequently, the Identify Risks process for a particular project \\nshould use a combination of techniques, perhaps selecting one from each category..For example, a project may \\nchoose to use a risk identification checklist (historical review), together with assumptions analysis (current \\nassessment) and brainstorming (creativity)..\\n Use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project, a prompt \\nlist, or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have \\nbeen addressed, while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking..\\n29\\n\\n5\\nCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n Whichever risk identification techniques are used, it is important that identified risks are unambiguously \\ndescribed in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or \\ndiluted by non-risks..Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity..Risk meta-language offers a useful \\nway of distinguishing a risk from its cause(s) and effect(s), describing each risk using three-part statements in \\nthe form: “As a result of cause, risk may occur, which would lead to effect.”.The relationship between cause, \\nrisk, and effect is shown in Figure 5-2..\\n \\n Figure 5-2..Cause, Risk, and Effect \\n 5.4 Documenting the Results of the Identify Risks Process \\n The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information \\ncurrently available for each identified risk..The main output from the Identify Risks process is the risk register..\\nThis includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk, and may also \\ninclude information on the causes and effects of the risk, trigger conditions, and preliminary responses..\\n31\\n\\n6\\n CHAPTER 6 \\n PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS \\n 6.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Qualitative Risk \\nAnalysis Process \\n The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually \\nidentified project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreed-upon characteristics..\\n Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur \\nand the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives..As such it does not directly address the overall \\nrisk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with \\neach other..This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques (see Chapter 7)..\\n One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes..If several risks arise \\nfrom a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus \\non addressing this root cause..\\n Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identification of the areas of greatest risk exposure \\n(e.g. to the project completion date, the budget, or a particular deliverable’s scope), facilitating risk response \\nfocus in these areas..\\n The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify \\nRisks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most infl uence \\n(positive or negative) on achieving the project’s objectives..Risks that are assessed as high priority to either \\nthreaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the Plan Risk \\nResponses process..They may be further analyzed, such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is \\ndiscussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process..\\n 6.2 Critical Success Factors for the Perform Qualitative Risk \\nAnalysis Process \\n Several factors that lead to successful qualitative risk analysis are described in Sections 6.2.1 through \\n6.2.4, and summarized in Figure 6-1..Agreement of the project stakeholders is a fundamental criterion and \\na common theme..The agreed-upon approach is the foundation of process credibility..Then, agreed-upon \\ndefinitions enable high-quality information to be collected..Finally, with these conditions in place, the process \\ncan be executed reliably, which contributes to the credibility of its outputs..\\n32\\n\\n6\\nCHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n \\n Figure 6 -1..Building Risk Analysis Credibility \\n 6.2.1 Use Agreed-Upon Approach \\n .The process is based on an agreed-upon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the \\nidentified risks in any project..By the nature of project risk, all risks may be assessed according to probability \\nof occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur..Other factors may be considered in \\ndetermining the importance of a risk as follows: \\n \\n• Urgency (proximity)..Risks requiring near term responses may be considered more urgent to \\naddress..Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the \\nclarity of symptoms and warning signs (also known as detectability) that may trigger the response..\\n Manageability..\\n•.\\n Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to \\naddress them..The project team may examine these and decide to: \\n Go forward, perhaps establishing a contingency reserve..\\n \\n○\\n Stop or re-scope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an \\n \\n○\\n opportunity that should not be missed with high probability and consequences..\\n Inform the customer of the risks and ask for a decision from their point of view..\\n \\n○\\n Impact external to the project..\\n•.\\n A risk may increase in importance if it affects the enterprise beyond \\nthe project..\\n 6.2.2 Use Agreed-Upon Definitions of Risk Terms \\n The risk assessment should be based on agreed-upon definitions of important terms, and those definitions \\nshould be used consistently when assessing each risk..The use of definitions, for example, of levels of probability \\nand of impact on objectives, assists the providers of the information in giving realistic assessments for each \\nrisk, and facilitates the communication of the results to management and other stakeholders..\\n33\\n\\n6\\nCHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n 6.2.3 Collect High-Quality Information about Risks \\n Collection of high-quality information about risks is required..Often this information is not available in any \\nhistoric database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment..Data \\ngathered from individuals may be subject to reporting or intentional bias..When this occurs, the bias should be \\nidentified and remedied where possible, or a different, unbiased source of information should be found and used..\\n 6.2.4 Perform Iterative Qualitative Risk Analysis \\n The success of qualitative risk analysis is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project..It \\nis impossible to know in advance all the risks that may occur in a project, therefore the Identify Risks and Perform \\nQualitative Analysis processes should be repeated periodically for individual risks..The frequency of this effort will \\nbe planned in the Plan Risk Management process, but may also depend on events within the project itself..\\n 6.3 Tools and Techniques for the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process \\n The tools and techniques used for assessing individual risks will identify the risks that are important to the \\nproject’s success..This process is illustrated in Figure 6-2..\\n \\n Figure 6-2..The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process \\n34\\n\\n6\\nCHAPTER 6 − PERFORM.QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n .6.3.1 Select Risk Characteristics that Define Risks’ Importance \\n Qualitative risk analysis tools provide ways to distinguish those risks that are important for response or \\nfurther analysis from those that are less important..The criteria that make a risk of interest to management are \\nagreed upon in advance and implemented in the tools used..Output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes \\na listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups (e.g., high, moderate, and low)..\\n The tools for qualitative risk analysis allow the organization or project stakeholders to specify those levels \\nor combinations of risk characteristics that make a particular risk of interest to management..Most tools assess \\na risk’s importance from a combination of probability of occurrence and degree of impact on objectives..\\n 6.3.2 Collect and Analyze Data \\n Assessment of individual risks is based on information collected about them..Therefore, data collection \\nand evaluation tools, including interviews, workshops, and references to databases of prior projects, require \\nmanagement support and attention..It is important to protect against bias in data gathering, which is important \\nwhen relying on expert judgment for the information..6.3.3 Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Specific Objectives \\n Some tools permit distinguishing a risk’s priority in terms of the affected objective..This capability provides \\na list of risks that are important for any specific objective of interest to management..This is useful since it is \\ncommon for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives..\\n 6.3.4.Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Overall Project \\n There are reasons for constructing a measure of a specific risk’s importance to the entire project as \\ncontrasted with its importance to specific objectives..A common reason is for ease of communication with \\nmanagement and other stakeholders..When a single risk prioritization index is needed, the organization should \\nbe explicit about how that index is created..Usually the index refl ects the organization’s preference among \\nobjectives..The technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the Plan Risk \\nManagement process..\\n35\\n\\n6\\nCHAPTER 6 − PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS\\n 6.3.5 Categorize Risk Causes \\n Categorizing risks appropriately may lead to improved analysis of the probability and magnitude of \\nproject risk and to effective responses..Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better \\nunderstanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate \\nand independent events..Identifying common root causes of a group of risks, for instance, may reveal both the \\nmagnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several \\nrisks simultaneously..Alternatively, some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding \\nthe chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project..Identifying risks \\nthat can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of \\nproblems of risk mitigation using scarce resources..\\n Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure \\n(see Identify Risks, Chapter 5) can show clusters of priority risks arising from specific sources..A combination \\nof the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure (WBS) can show which areas of the project \\nexhibit the most risk..Assessing the high-priority risks’ impact on one objective, such as the schedule, may \\nindicate which activities to address to reduce that objective’s uncertainty..All of these approaches can contribute \\nto the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis..\\n 6.3.6 Document the Results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process \\n .The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks (see Identify \\nRisks, Chapter 5) into categories of priority..Priorities are usually based on the risk’s probability of occurring \\nand its potential impact on specific project objectives or on the whole project..Each identified risk is assigned \\na priority, perhaps by objective or for the entire project..This information is usually stored in the risk register \\nwhich is easy to use and update with new information..The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the \\nproject participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan..Risks that \\nare judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally \\nmonitored frequently..Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less \\noften for changes in their status.\""

              "\" Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing and combining their probability of occurrence and impact.The key beneft of this process is that it enables project managers to reduce the level of uncertainty and to focus on high-priority risks.The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure -Figure - depicts the data fow diagram of the process.

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis assesses the priority of identifed risks using their relative probability or likelihood of occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, as well as other factors such as the time frame for response and the organization’s risk tolerance associated with the project constraints of cost, schedule, scope, and quality.Such assessments refect the risk attitude of the project team and other stakeholders.Effective assessment therefore requires explicit identifcation and management of the risk approaches of key participants in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process.Where these risk approaches introduce bias into the assessment of identifed risks, attention should be paid to identifying bias and correcting for it. Establishing defnitions of the levels of probability and impact can reduce the infuence of bias.The time criticality of risk-related actions may magnify the importance of a risk.An evaluation of the quality of the available information on project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of the risk’s importance to the project. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is usually a rapid and cost-effective means of establishing priorities for Plan Risk Responses and lays the foundation for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, if required.The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as defned in the project’s risk management plan.This process can lead into Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis (Section Risk Responses (Section  Described in Section Key elements of the risk management plan used in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process include roles and responsibilities for conducting risk management, budgets, schedule activities for risk management, risk categories, defnitions of probability and impact, the probability and impact matrix, and revised stakeholders’ risk tolerances.These inputs are usually tailored to the project during the Plan Risk Management process.If they are not available, they may be developed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Described in Section Projects of a common or recurrent type tend to have more well-understood risks. Projects using state-of-the-art or frst-of-its-kind technology, and highly complex projects, tend to have more uncertainty.This can be evaluated by examining the scope baseline. Licensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction. Described in Section The risk register contains the information that will be used to assess and prioritize risks. Described in Section Enterprise environmental factors may provide insight and context to the risk assessment, such as: • Industry studies of similar projects by risk specialists, and • Risk databases that may be available from industry or proprietary sources. Described in Section The organizational process assets that can infuence the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process include information on prior, similar completed projects. Risk probability assessment investigates the likelihood that each specifc risk will occur.Risk impact assessment investigates the potential effect on a project objective such as schedule, cost, quality, or performance, including both negative effects for threats and positive effects for opportunities. Probability and impact are assessed for each identifed risk.Risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings with participants selected for their familiarity with the risk categories on the agenda.Project team members and knowledgeable persons external to the project are included. The level of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective is evaluated during the interview or meeting. Explanatory detail, including assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are also recorded.Risk probabilities and impacts are rated according to the defnitions given in the risk management plan.Risks with low ratings of probability and impact will be included within the risk register as part of the watch list for future monitoring. Licensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction. Risks can be prioritized for further quantitative analysis and planning risk responses based on their risk rating. Ratings are assigned to risks based on their assessed probability and impact.Evaluation of each risk’s importance and priority for attention is typically conducted using a look-up table or a probability and impact matrix.Such a matrix specifes combinations of probability and impact that lead to rating the risks as low, moderate, or high priority.Descriptive terms or numeric values can be used depending on organizational preference. Each risk is rated on its probability of occurrence and impact on an objective if it does occur.The organization should determine which combinations of probability and impact result in a classifcation of high risk, moderate risk, and low risk.In a black-and-white matrix, these conditions are denoted using different shades of gray.Specifcally in Figure -, the dark gray area (with the largest numbers) represents high risk: the medium gray area (with the smallest numbers) represents low risk, and the light gray area (with in-between numbers) represents moderate risk.Usually, these risk-rating rules are specifed by the organization in advance of the project and included in organizational process assets.Risk rating rules can be tailored in the Plan Risk Management process to the specifc project. Probability and Impact Matrix Probability Very Low Low Moderate High Very High Impact (numerical scale) on an objective (e.g., cost, time, scope or quality) Each risk is rated on its probability of occurring and impact on an objective if it does occur.The organization's thresholds for low, moderate or high risks are shown in the matrix and determine whether the risk is scored as high, moderate or low for that objective. Threats Very Low Low Moderate High Very High Opportunities Figure -Probability and Impact Matrix Licensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction. As illustrated in Figure -, an organization can rate a risk separately for each objective (e.g., cost, time, and scope).In addition, it may develop ways to determine one overall rating for each risk.Finally, opportunities and threats are handled in the same matrix using defnitions of the different levels of impact that are appropriate for each. The risk score helps guide risk responses.For example, risks that have a negative impact on objectives, otherwise known as threats if they occur, and that are in the high-risk (dark gray) zone of the matrix, may require priority action and aggressive response strategies.Threats found in the low-risk (medium gray) zone may not require proactive management action beyond being placed in the risk register as part of the watch list or adding a contingency reserve.Similarly for opportunities, those in the high-risk (dark gray) zone, which may be obtained most easily and offer the greatest beneft, should be targeted frst.Opportunities in the low-risk (medium gray) zone should be monitored. Risk data quality assessment is a technique to evaluate the degree to which the data about risks is useful for risk management.It involves examining the degree to which the risk is understood and the accuracy, quality, reliability, and integrity of the data about the risk. The use of low-quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis of little use to the project.If data quality is unacceptable, it may be necessary to gather better data.Often, the collection of information about risks is diffcult, and consumes more time and resources than originally planned.The values used in the example in Figure - are representative.The numbers of steps in the scale are usually established when defning the risk attitude of the organization. Risks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (e.g., using the RBS), the area of the project affected (e.g., using the WBS), or other useful categories (e.g., project phase) to determine the areas of the project most exposed to the effects of uncertainty.Risks can also be categorized by common root causes.This technique helps determine work packages, activities, project phases or even roles in the project, which can lead to the development of effective risk responses. Licensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction. Risks requiring near-term responses may be considered more urgent to address.Indicators of priority may include probability of detecting the risk, time to affect a risk response, symptoms and warning signs, and the risk rating.In some qualitative analyses, the assessment of risk urgency is combined with the risk ranking that is determined from the probability and impact matrix to give a fnal risk severity rating. Expert judgment is required to assess the probability and impact of each risk to determine its location in the matrix shown in Figure -Experts generally are those having experience with similar, recent projects. Gathering expert judgment is often accomplished with the use of risk facilitation workshops or interviews.The experts’ bias should be taken into account in this process. Project documents that may be updated include, but are not limited to: • risk register updates.As new information becomes available through the qualitative risk assessment, the risk register is updated.Updates to the risk register may include assessments of probability and impacts for each risk, risk ranking or scores, risk urgency information or risk categorization, and a watch list for low probability risks or risks requiring further analysis. • Assumptions log updates.As new information becomes available through the qualitative risk assessment, assumptions could change.The assumptions log needs to be revisited to accommodate this new information.Assumptions may be incorporated into the project scope statement or in a separate assumptions log. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the effect of identifed risks on overall project objectives.The key beneft of this process is that it produces quantitative risk information to support decision making in order to reduce project uncertainty.The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure -Figure - depicts the data fow diagram of the process.

PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT The objectives of the Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy for the project, to decide how the risk management processes will be executed, and to integrate Project Risk Management with all other project management activities. Effective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan.This plan describes how the risk management processes should be carried out and how they fit in with the other project management processes.On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project management, and the management processes in the rest of the organization.To provide the greatest benefit, initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan.The risk management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders become clearer or change. Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management plan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the specific risk management activities should be established in order to better track, control, and, as necessary, defend the corresponding expenditures throughout the project.The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project budget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated, allocated, and managed.The risk management plan will define the monitoring methods to ensure that the corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved budget for risk management can be modified. In the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration, risk management activities need to be repeated throughout the project.The risk management plan should define both the normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as specific or exceptional conditions under which the corresponding actions should be initiated.The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated into the project management plan. There are two categories of success criteria for risk management: those for success of the project in general, and those for success of Project Risk Management. • Project-Related Criteria.To assess the success of Project Risk Management, the stakeholders must agree on an acceptable level of results for the project-related criteria (such as cost, time, and scope).In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management plan should present these objectives with reference to the project definition documents.To provide guidance in risk management, particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also prioritize each project objective. • Process-Related Criteria.The measures for success in Project Risk Management depend on a number of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project.For example, the Project Risk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than for a project with a more predictable environment.A research Project Risk Management process may be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be allowable for a successful process in a more predictable project. The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant stakeholders.The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be infl uenced by a number of factors, all of which need to be identified.These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and the relative importance to them of achieving or missing specific project objectives.The output of this analysis should then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the Project Risk Management processes in the specific project. Guidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders should refl ect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders.The project manager should maintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware of any changes in the stakeholders’ attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts into account. It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks, and that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be defined in a manner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders.If qualitative analysis uses such terms as “high impact” or “medium probability,” these should be defined objectively in the risk management plan.Similarly, the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in quantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control. Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a template of the risk register that will be used for recording risk-related information.The risk management plan should also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management processes should be applied; this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the specified risk management objectives. In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project team and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate, their criteria for determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond this level.The risk management plan specifies the project’s risk management roles and responsibilities and defines the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel. Risk-related communication occurs at two levels: (a) within the project team, and (b) between the project team and the other project stakeholders.The principles for each of these categories of communication are defined in the risk management plan.For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various risk management meetings and reports required to carry out the corresponding Project Risk Management processes as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports.For the other stakeholders, the plan sets their expectations as to the structure, content, and frequency of routine documents to be received as well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events.Details of the information required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly defined. The principal criteria for a valid risk management plan are acceptance by the stakeholders, alignment with the internal and external constraints on the project, balance between cost or effort and benefit, and completeness with respect to the needs of the Project Risk Management process.Critical success factors for the Plan Risk Management process are detailed below. The time and effort required to carry out the Plan Risk Management process will not be supported unless the stakeholders, and especially management in the organization responsible for the project, recognize and accept the benefits of managing risk, and the added value of addressing this as a skill in its own right rather than as a passive or reactive component of general project management. A clear definition of the project objectives and a high-level view of the project environment and solution approach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management.The project manager should therefore ensure that valid definition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity. An organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and may expend an inappropriate amount of time and effort on this.Alternatively it may use a proprietary or pre-existing approach which requires tailoring.The availability of some or all of the following organizational process assets contributes to the chances of success of the Plan Risk Management activities: standard templates, predefined risk categories, and an established project management methodology incorporating risk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making, when it is required, and a definition of concepts and terms, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels.Access to relevant lessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project.The risk management plan will not deliver its value unless Project Risk Management is carried out as an integral part of the project.The corresponding activities should be built into the project work breakdown structure and included in the corresponding schedule, budget, and work-assignment documents.\\n22\\n\\n4\\nCHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT\\n 4.2.2 Involve Project Stakeholders inProject Risk Management The project manager needs to involve the project stakeholders in the Plan Risk Management activities to build on their skills and experience as well as to ensure their understanding of, and commitment to, the full Project Risk Management process. The provision for risk management resources specified within the risk management plan should be approved by management at a level adequate for carrying out the required Project Risk Management processes in accordance with agreed-upon objectives.Management should be involved in the analysis of the level of resourcing required for managing project risk and accept the risks that may arise from specific limitations placed on the provision of resources.Disagreements between stakeholders in the areas of risk tolerance and evaluation measures should be addressed and resolved.\\n 4.2.3Comply with the Organization’s Objectives, Policies, and Practices The feasibility of risk management planning is dependent upon the features of the organization in which it is carried out.The rules and guidelines defined in the risk management plan should be compatible with the culture of the organization, its capabilities from the point of view of people and facilities, and its values, goals, and objectives. Project management in general, and risk management in particular, contribute to the organization’s effective governance.The risk management plan should identify and take into account the relevant organizational procedures and any other enterprise environmental factors that apply such as strategic risk management or corporate governance processes. Planning sessions are recommended in order to build a common understanding of the project’s risk approach between project stakeholders and to gain agreement on the techniques to be used for managing risk. Elaboration of the risk management plan often serves to develop an effective means for the team to work together since a similar consultative team approach will be used in subsequent stages of the risk management process.The participants should include: the project manager, selected project team members and other stakeholders, members of the broader organization having responsibility for risk, and other subject matter experts or facilitators, as needed. At this point, the initial risk responsibilities, methodology, templates, terms, definitions, time schedules, and cost budgets for the other Project Risk Management processes should be assigned and accepted.The specification for the tools that will be used in subsequent processes should include all parameters and other inputs required to ensure their applicability to the specific project.These should be documented in the risk management plan, which, when formally approved, is the principal deliverable of the Plan Risk Management process. In order to benefit from experience and existing best practice, risk management planning should take into account relevant existing templates for work products, such as risk status reports, risk breakdown structures or the risk register.A decision should be made as to which templates are relevant to the project, and these should then be adapted and included in the risk management plan. The results of risk management planning are documented in the risk management plan.The plan serves to provide all project stakeholders with a common view of how the risk-related activities of the project will be handled, what has been agreed upon, and a description of the stakeholders’ involvement and responsibilities in these activities.An overview of the key areas of focus is given in Figure - Figure -Key Areas of Focus for the Plan Risk Management Process Depending upon the size and complexity of the project, some or all of the following elements will be present in a risk management plan. Introduction; • Project description; • Risk management methodology; • Risk management organization; •Roles, responsibilities, and authority; • Stakeholder risk tolerance; • Criteria for success; • Risk management tools and guidelines for use; • Thresholds and corresponding definitions; • Templates; • Communications plan; • Strategy; and • Risk breakdown structure. • IDENTIFY RISKS A risk cannot be managed unless it is first identified.Consequently, after risk management planning has been completed, the first process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the knowable risks to project objectives. It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project.Over time, the level of project risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project (internal change) and of externally imposed change. The purpose of risk identification is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable.The fact that some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process to find new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process. When a risk is first identified, potential responses may also be identified at the same time.These should be recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate. Where such responses are not implemented immediately, these should be considered during the Plan Risk Responses process. The practices described in Sections Identify Risks process and enhance the likelihood of identifying as many risks as practicable. Risk identification should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle, recognizing the paradox that uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the risk identification.Early risk identification enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks inherent in the project, and may result in changes to the project strategy.It also maximizes the time available for development and implementation of risk responses, which enhances efficiency since responses taken early are often normally less costly than later ones. Since not all risks can be identified at any given point in the project, it is essential that risk identification is repeated throughout the project life cycle.This should be done periodically, at a frequency determined during the Plan Risk Management process.Risk identification might also be repeated at key milestones in the project, or whenever there is significant change to the project or its operating environment. In addition to invoking the Identify Risks process as defined in the project plan, the Project Risk Management process should permit risks to be identified at any time, not limited to formal risk identification events or regular reviews. A broad range of sources of risk should be considered to ensure that as many uncertainties as possible that might affect objectives have been identified. The Identify Risks process should ensure opportunities are properly considered.\\n 5.2.6 Multiple Perspectives \\n The Identify Risks process should take input from a broad range of project stakeholders to ensure that all perspectives are represented and considered.Limiting risk identification to the immediate project team is unlikely to expose all knowable risks. Each identified project risk should relate to at least one project objective (time, cost, quality, scope, etc.), noting that the PMBOK ® Guide defines risk as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project’s objectives.Consideration of each project objective during the Identify Risks process will assist in identifying risks, noting that some risks may affect more than one objective.Complete Risk Statement Identified risks should be clearly and unambiguously described, so that they can be understood by those responsible for risk assessment and risk response planning.Single words or phrases such as “resources” or “logistics” are inadequate and do not properly communicate the nature of the risk.More detailed risk descriptions are required which explicitly state the uncertainty and its causes and effects. Risks can be identified at a number of levels of detail.A generalized or high-level description of risk can make it difficult to develop responses and assign ownership, while describing risks in a lot of detail can create a great deal of work.Each risk should be described at a level of detail at which it can be assigned to a single risk owner with clear responsibility and accountability for its management.Trigger conditions should also be identified where this is possible and appropriate. All human activities are susceptible to bias, especially when dealing with uncertainty.Both motivational biases, where someone is trying to bias the result in one direction or another, or cognitive biases, where biases occur as people are using their best judgment and applying heuristics, may occur.This should be explicitly recognized and addressed during the Identify Risks process.Sources of bias should be exposed wherever possible, and their effect on the risk process should be managed proactively.The aim is to minimize subjectivity, and allow open and honest identification of as many risks as possible to the project. A range of tools and techniques is available for risk identification.These fall into the following three categories, as illustrated in Figure -: Figure -Three Perspectives of Risk Identification Historical reviews are based on what occurred in the past, either on this project, or other similar projects in the same organization, or comparable projects in other organizations.Historical review approaches rely on careful selection of comparable situations which are genuinely similar to the current project, and filtering of data to ensure that only relevant previous risks are considered.In each case, the risks identified in the selected historical situation should be considered, asking whether they or similar risks might arise in this project. Current assessments rely on detailed consideration of the current project, analyzing its characteristics against given frameworks and models in order to expose areas of uncertainty.Unlike historical review approaches, current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points, but are based purely on examination of the project. A wide range of creativity techniques can be used for risk identification, which encourages project stakeholders to use their imagination to find risks which might affect the project.The outcomes or effectiveness of these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively.These techniques can be used either singly or in groups, and employ varying degrees of structure.These techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively, and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator. Each category of risk identification technique has strengths and weaknesses, and no single technique can be expected to reveal all knowable risks.Consequently, the Identify Risks process for a particular project should use a combination of techniques, perhaps selecting one from each category.For example, a project may choose to use a risk identification checklist (historical review), together with assumptions analysis (current assessment) and brainstorming (creativity). Use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project, a prompt list, or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have been addressed, while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking. Whichever risk identification techniques are used, it is important that identified risks are unambiguously described in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or diluted by non-risks.Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity.Risk meta-language offers a useful way of distinguishing a risk from its cause(s) and effect(s), describing each risk using three-part statements in the form: “As a result of cause, risk may occur, which would lead to effect.”The relationship between cause, risk, and effect is shown in Figure - Figure -Cause, Risk, and Effect The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information currently available for each identified risk.The main output from the Identify Risks process is the risk register. This includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk, and may also include information on the causes and effects of the risk, trigger conditions, and preliminary responses. PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS Analysis Process The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually identified project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreed-upon characteristics. Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives.As such it does not directly address the overall risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with each other.This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques (see Chapter ). One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes.If several risks arise from a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus on addressing this root cause. Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identification of the areas of greatest risk exposure (e.g. to the project completion date, the budget, or a particular deliverable’s scope), facilitating risk response focus in these areas. The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify Risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most infl uence (positive or negative) on achieving the project’s objectives.Risks that are assessed as high priority to either threaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the Plan Risk Responses process.They may be further analyzed, such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is discussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. Analysis Process Several factors that lead to successful qualitative risk analysis are described in Sections Agreement of the project stakeholders is a fundamental criterion and a common theme.The agreed-upon approach is the foundation of process credibility.Then, agreed-upon definitions enable high-quality information to be collected.Finally, with these conditions in place, the process can be executed reliably, which contributes to the credibility of its outputs. Figure -Building Risk Analysis Credibility The process is based on an agreed-upon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the identified risks in any project.By the nature of project risk, all risks may be assessed according to probability of occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur.Other factors may be considered in determining the importance of a risk as follows: • Urgency (proximity).Risks requiring near term responses may be considered more urgent to address.Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the clarity of symptoms and warning signs (also known as detectability) that may trigger the response. Manageability. • Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to address them.The project team may examine these and decide to: Go forward, perhaps establishing a contingency reserve. ○ Stop or re-scope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an ○ opportunity that should not be missed with high probability and consequences. Inform the customer of the risks and ask for a decision from their point of view. ○ Impact external to the project. • A risk may increase in importance if it affects the enterprise beyond the project. The risk assessment should be based on agreed-upon definitions of important terms, and those definitions should be used consistently when assessing each risk.The use of definitions, for example, of levels of probability and of impact on objectives, assists the providers of the information in giving realistic assessments for each risk, and facilitates the communication of the results to management and other stakeholders. Collection of high-quality information about risks is required.Often this information is not available in any historic database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment.Data gathered from individuals may be subject to reporting or intentional bias.When this occurs, the bias should be identified and remedied where possible, or a different, unbiased source of information should be found and used. The success of qualitative risk analysis is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project.It is impossible to know in advance all the risks that may occur in a project, therefore the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative Analysis processes should be repeated periodically for individual risks.The frequency of this effort will be planned in the Plan Risk Management process, but may also depend on events within the project itself. The tools and techniques used for assessing individual risks will identify the risks that are important to the project’s success.This process is illustrated in Figure - Figure -The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS  Qualitative risk analysis tools provide ways to distinguish those risks that are important for response or further analysis from those that are less important.The criteria that make a risk of interest to management are agreed upon in advance and implemented in the tools used.Output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes a listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups (e.g., high, moderate, and low). The tools for qualitative risk analysis allow the organization or project stakeholders to specify those levels or combinations of risk characteristics that make a particular risk of interest to management.Most tools assess a risk’s importance from a combination of probability of occurrence and degree of impact on objectives. Assessment of individual risks is based on information collected about them.Therefore, data collection and evaluation tools, including interviews, workshops, and references to databases of prior projects, require management support and attention.It is important to protect against bias in data gathering, which is important when relying on expert judgment for the information. Some tools permit distinguishing a risk’s priority in terms of the affected objective.This capability provides a list of risks that are important for any specific objective of interest to management.This is useful since it is common for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives.\\n 6.3.4Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Overall Project There are reasons for constructing a measure of a specific risk’s importance to the entire project as contrasted with its importance to specific objectives.A common reason is for ease of communication with management and other stakeholders.When a single risk prioritization index is needed, the organization should be explicit about how that index is created.Usually the index refl ects the organization’s preference among objectives.The technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the Plan Risk Management process. Categorizing risks appropriately may lead to improved analysis of the probability and magnitude of project risk and to effective responses.Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better understanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate and independent events.Identifying common root causes of a group of risks, for instance, may reveal both the magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several risks simultaneously.Alternatively, some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project.Identifying risks that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources. Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure (see Identify Risks, Chapter ) can show clusters of priority risks arising from specific sources.A combination of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure (WBS) can show which areas of the project exhibit the most risk.Assessing the high-priority risks’ impact on one objective, such as the schedule, may indicate which activities to address to reduce that objective’s uncertainty.All of these approaches can contribute to the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis.\\n 6.3.6 Document the Results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process \\n The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks (see Identify Risks, Chapter ) into categories of priority.Priorities are usually based on the risk’s probability of occurring and its potential impact on specific project objectives or on the whole project.Each identified risk is assigned a priority, perhaps by objective or for the entire project.This information is usually stored in the risk register which is easy to use and update with new information.The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the project participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan.Risks that are judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally monitored frequently.Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less often for changes in their status.\""
